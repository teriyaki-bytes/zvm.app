# Contributing and Notice

`zvm` is stable software. Pre-v1.0.0 any breaking changes will be clearly
labeled, and any commands potentially on the chopping block will print notice.
The program is under constant development, and the author is very willing to
work with contributors. **If you have any issues, ideas, or contributions you'd
like to suggest
[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/tristanisham/zvm/issues/new/choose)**.
